# Summary

In this tutorial, you learned how to build a fully-featured Hackernews clone with React and Apollo Client. You implemented several features, such as displaying a list of links, signup and authentication, creating new links, voting on links, pagination as well as realtime updates with GraphQL subscriptions. For a longer tutorial that covers more advanced features of Apollo Client, check out the GraphQL Guide.

To learn how to build the backend that you used for this tutorial, check out the Node.JS tutorial.

The backend was powered by graphql-yoga, a fast and simple GraphQL server library built on top of Express.js. It comes with several features, such as out-of-the-box support for GraphQL Playground and realtime GraphQL subscriptions.

The resolvers of your GraphQL server are implemented using the Prisma client that’s responsible for database access.
